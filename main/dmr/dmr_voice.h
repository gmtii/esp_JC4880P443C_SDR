/*
 * DMR voice, phase 2: AMBE+2 (3600x2450) decoding with mbelib.
 *
 * mbelib is an OPTIONAL component, off by default: the AMBE+2 algorithm is
 * covered by patents in some countries, so the library is not shipped in this
 * repository. To enable voice:
 *   1. tools/fetch_mbelib.sh   (clones mbelib into components/mbelib/mbelib)
 *   2. idf.py menuconfig -> "SDR: DMR" -> "DMR voice (mbelib)"
 * Without it everything below compiles to no-ops and DMR stays metadata-only
 * (dmr_voice_available() returns false).
 *
 * Each voice burst (A..F) carries three 72-bit AMBE+2 frames: dibits 0-35,
 * 36-53 + 78-95 (split around the centre sync/EMB field) and 96-131. Every
 * frame is de-interleaved into mbelib's ambe_fr[4][24] with the DMR AMBE
 * interleave schedule from DSD (ISC licence, credited in dmr_voice.c).
 *
 * Only one slot is heard at a time: in AUTO the first slot to start talking
 * is followed until its call ends (terminator, or no voice for 500 ms); a
 * preference forces TS1 or TS2. Calls flagged as encrypted (privacy bit in
 * the LC service options) are not played.

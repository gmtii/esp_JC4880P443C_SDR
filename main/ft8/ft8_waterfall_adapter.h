 * (GD32F450) firmware with its parameters UNCHANGED (3200 Hz, 1024-pt FFT,
 * time_osr=1, freq_osr=2, 256 bins = 1600 Hz search window, dB offset -112),
 * so behaviour matches what was validated on real hardware there. The only
 * changes are where the buffers live (PSRAM block in ft8_ram.h instead of the
 * GD32's waterfall union), the cascade row period (see the .c file) and
 * time_osr, raised back to 2 (see FT8_ADAPTER_TIME_OSR).

 * Feeds our OWN ft8_fft1024.c (a dedicated 1024-point real-input FFT -
 * see that module's header for why it's separate from fft.c/the main
 * spectrum's own 256-point one) into ft8_lib's ftx_waterfall_t format,
 * without needing kiss_fft, monitor.c, or audio.c from ft8_lib at all
 * - decode.h's API expects a caller-filled magnitude buffer, nothing
 * more.
 *
 * ft8_lib decodes real, already-demodulated audio (like WSJT-X does
 * off a USB receiver's audio output), NOT raw I/Q - confirmed by
 * reading common/monitor.c and demo/decode_ft8.c.
 *
 * PARAMETER DERIVATION (09/2026 REVISION - widened from the original
 * 400Hz design, per the project owner, "vamos alla" on step 2 of the
 * memory-budget plan below):
 *
 *   sample_rate = 3200 Hz         (chosen - see ft8_decimator.h for why
 *                                  this specific rate needed a real
 *                                  rational resampler, not a simple
 *                                  integer decimator like the original)
 *   symbol_period = 0.16s         (FT8_SYMBOL_PERIOD, fixed by the protocol)
 *   block_size  = sample_rate * symbol_period = 512 samples/symbol
 *   time_osr    = 2               (ESP32-P4; the GD32 used 1 for RAM - see FT8_ADAPTER_TIME_OSR)
 *   subblock_size = block_size / time_osr = 256 samples (=80ms) per feed (ESP32-P4, time_osr=2)
 *   freq_osr    = 2               (A/B tested, kept at ft8_lib's own default -
 *                                  see MEMORY BUDGET CONTEXT below for why this
 *                                  one specifically can't be reduced)
 *   nfft        = block_size * freq_osr = 1024  <-- == ft8_fft1024.h's FT8_FFT_SIZE, exactly
 *   native bin spacing at 3200Hz/1024pt = 3200/1024 = 3.125 Hz = 6.25Hz / freq_osr
 *     -> same ratio as the original 800Hz/256pt design (quadrupled both
 *        fs and nfft proportionally) - our own FFT's raw bins still sit
 *        exactly on ft8_lib's oversampled-bin grid, no extra interpolation
 *        needed (see ft8_waterfall_feed_subblock() and FT8_ADAPTER_RAW_BIN_STEP).
 *   max_blocks  = FT8_SLOT_TIME / symbol_period = 15.0/0.16 = 93 (truncated,
 *                 matches ft8_lib's own demo/monitor.c formula exactly - unchanged)
 *
 * FT8_ADAPTER_NUM_BINS = 256 (256 * 6.25Hz = 1600Hz search span) - the
 * ENTIRE useful output of a 1024-pt real FFT at 3200Hz
 * (FT8_FFT_BINS_USEFUL=512 raw bins / freq_osr(2) = 256 6.25Hz-bins),
 * same "cover everything available, not a narrow pre-tuned window"
 * choice as the original 400Hz design.

 * MEMORY BUDGET CONTEXT (09/2026) - two-step plan, per the project
 * owner, to widen the search window beyond the original 400Hz without
 * mag[] becoming impossibly large (block_stride = time_osr*freq_osr*
 * num_bins):
 *
 * STEP 1 (done first, fs still 800Hz/nfft still 256/window still
 * 400Hz) - A/B tested which oversampling axis actually costs decode
 * sensitivity if reduced from ft8_lib's own (2,2) default to 1:
 *
 *   (2,2), NUM_BINS=64  (400Hz): 93*2*2*64  = 23808 bytes (~23.2KB) - the ORIGINAL design
 *   (1,1), NUM_BINS=64  (400Hz): 93*1*1*64  =  5952 bytes (~5.8KB)  - LOST a real decode (CT3IQ EI8GVB IO63, -9dB)
 *   (2,1), NUM_BINS=64  (400Hz): 93*2*1*64  = 11904 bytes (~11.6KB) - ALSO lost that decode - FREQ_OSR is the sensitive axis
 *   (1,2), NUM_BINS=64  (400Hz): 93*1*2*64  = 11904 bytes (~11.6KB) - kept the decode, tested against 5 corpus files - the config actually shipped
 *
 * Conclusion: TIME_OSR is the "free" axis (halves mag[] with no
 * measured cost), FREQ_OSR is not.
 *
 * STEP 2 (this revision) - spends the RAM step 1 freed on an actually
 * wider window, via ft8_decimator.h's new rational resampler +
 * ft8_fft1024.h's bigger FFT:
 *
 *   (1,2), NUM_BINS=256 (1600Hz, fs=3200Hz/nfft=1024): 93*1*2*256 = 47616 bytes (~46.5KB)
 *
 * i.e. a 4x wider window (400Hz -> 1600Hz) for about double the
 * original (2,2)/400Hz design's RAM (23.2KB -> 46.5KB) - only possible
 * because step 1 already halved the per-bin cost first. Confirmed
 * against real hardware: two live decodes (9dB, 11dB - see this
 * session's own log) at the (1,2)/400Hz stage before committing to
 * this wider revision.
